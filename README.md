## Summary

This project is part of the *Protection, Automation, and Control in Electrical Energy Systems* 
subject. In this study, a small microgrid consisting of 6 households is modeled in MATLAB Simulink. 
Each of them has a grid-connected PV system and a three-phase load. The Battery Energy Storage 
System is also connected at the Point of Common Coupling. 

This study addresses the following questions:

1. Whether the battery energy storage system is sufficient during less PV generation period or not.
2. Determine the size of the Battery Energy Storage System for the micro-grid for one day autonomy.
3. What is the impact of dynamic tariff implementation in the microgrid compared to a fixed tariff?
4. What are the impacts of full feed-in and surplus feed-in of PV power generation to the
   micro-grid?

For this study, the one-day Global Tilted Irradiance forecast data, household load consumption 
data from a city in southern Germany, and one-day-ahead dynamic tariff data for the Amprion 
control region were utilized.
